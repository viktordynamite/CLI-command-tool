# CLI Command Tool (will change it's name)

Deceided to make my own version of simple command-line tool to store, search, and retrieve frequently used terminal commands since I am avid terminal user.


## Features (For now) (Not implemented functionality)

- **Store Commands**: Save commands with descriptions for future reference
- **List Commands**: View all your saved commands in one place
